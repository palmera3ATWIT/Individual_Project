Data Science Fundamentals Individual Research Project
## Introduction
For my individual Data Science project, I decided to do a statistical analysis of the stock market. The three questions I decided to look into are:
1)  What stocks in the tech sector have the closest relationship?
2)  What holiday produces the most stock growth?
3)  What time duration of options produces the most profit?

## Data Selection
For most of the stock data, I will be using yahoo finance, which allows users to directly create a csv for any stock with very good historical stock data. For supplementary data(for options specificaly), I will be using tradytics which has historical options data for the past 3 months.
